# PRACTICE: REACT WHIT TYPESCRIPT - THE STAR WARS API

## Project description

Practice related to the use of asynchronous requests and responses from an api, in this case "SWAPI - the star wars api".

In the same way, it would be an introductory practice to the use of tests in our application and react components, in this case using Jest and React Testing Library.

All of the above without stopping using typescript, which for me has become essential in my projects.

## Used technology

- Html 5
- CSS
- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- React
- React Redux
- Redux Tool Kit
- React Router Dom V6
- Fetch API
- Styled Components
- Jest
- React Testing Library
- ESLint
- Prettier
- Yarn
- Vite

## Resources used

SWAPI - The Star Wars API: https://swapi.dev/

## Developers: Requirements

- Nodejs
- Web Browser
- Code editor

## Developers: Installtion

1. Clone the repository: https://github.com/newmanferrer/practice-300722-swapi.git
2. Another option is to download the repository using ZIP format.
3. Install the dependencies using the command "yarn", from the terminal console.
4. From the terminal console, execute the “yarn dev” command, to run the development server.
5. To run the tests, in the console run the command "yarn test".

# Important Notes, Suggestions and Recommendations

A recommendation would always be to take a few minutes to study well the api that we will use, this can save us a lot of time when we define our endpoints and data recovery and use strategies.

In the same way, if we use typescript, it would be a good idea to count the data models that we will use, this is generally provided in the api documentation.
